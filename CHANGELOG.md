### Layout
1. Removal of left toolbar, tools now appear in the right toolbar
2. Panel on left removed, tools that were on the left now appear floating in the top right corner of the map. Panels are also collapsable,useful while on mobile and need access to the map.
3. When tool panel is closed, the tool is disabled and the identify tool is re-enabled

### Property
1. 1/2 not showing in half addresses for the site address.  This has always been an issue in every version of iMAPS.  
2. Address table now exportable
3. If more fields are enabled in the property list, those fields will be enabled when you return to iMAPS
4. Much faster loading of property information when a property is selected

### Layer List
1. By default only the property layer and the layers visible in previous session are loaded.
2. Once you click on the layer list button, the rest of the layers are loaded.
3. This should greatly improve load times.

### Basemaps
1. Blend option (currently in beta) has been added.  
   1. 3 steps:
      1. Choose base map
      2. Choose image map
      3. Set transparency


### Sketch
1. More customization of symbols
2. Added more marker symbol options

### Measure
1. Coordinate conversion widget removed and  added to the lower left corner of the map.

### Header
1. Reset to default button added.  This will reset iMAPS to the default extent, layers, and base  map.
   1. This was added in case there are issues with what is stored in local storage

### Code
1. React JS code has been refactored to follow best practices.
2. Better separation of view and controller
